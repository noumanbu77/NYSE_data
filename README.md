# NYSE-Data_spreadsheets
In this project we will analyse real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. We will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. We have created a smaller subset of the data to be used for this data. 
The following information is included in the Projectdata NYSE file:

- Ticker symbol: Stock symbol
- Years: Number of years for which data is provided
- Period ending
- Total revenue
- Cost of goods sold
- Sales, General, and Administrative expenses
- Research and Development expenses
- Other Operating expense items
- Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Sector: The industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., American Airlines with the ticker symbol AAL is categorized under Industrials.)
- GICS Sub Industry: Sub-industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., AAL is further categorized under the sub-category of the "Airlines" industry.)
